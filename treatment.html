        <p class="info-text">
            Before a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation,
            including an interview and a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure
            the depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem or a vitamin deficiency (reversing
            the medical cause would alleviate the depression-like symptoms). The evaluation will identify specific
            symptoms and explore medical and family histories as well as cultural and environmental factors with the
            goal of arriving at a diagnosis and planning a course of action.
        </p>
        <p class="info-subHeading">Medication</p>
        <p>
            Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this
            reason, antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one’s brain chemistry. These medications are not
            sedatives, “uppers” or tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have
            no stimulating effect on people not experiencing depression.
            Antidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use yet full benefits may not
            be seen for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her
            psychiatrist can alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some
            situations other psychotropic medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a
            medication does not work or if you experience side effects.
            Psychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after the
            symptoms have improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future
            episodes for certain people at high risk.
        </p>
        <p class="info-subHeading">Psychotherapy</p>
        <p>
            or “talk therapy,” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe
            depression, psychotherapy is often used along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy
            (CBT) has been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the problem
            solving in the present. CBT helps a person to recognize distorted/negative thinking with the goal of
            changing thoughts and behaviors to respond to challenges in a more positive manner.
            Psychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples
            therapy can help address issues within these close relationships. Group therapy brings people with similar
            illnesses together in a supportive environment, and can assist the participant to learn how others cope in
            similar situations. Depending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much
            longer. In many cases, significant improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions.
        </p>
        <p class="info-subHeading">Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)</p>
        <p>
            is a medical treatment that has been most commonly reserved for patients with severe major depression who have not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments. It is usually managed by a team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant. ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements and the recognition of its effectiveness as a mainstream rather than a "last resort" treatment. 
        </p>
        <p class="info-subHeading">Other</p>
        <p>
            There are a number of other things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise helps create positive feeling and improves mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.
